# From Skeletal Motion to Conformal Geometric Algebra: A Novel Approach to Human Motion Modeling

## Introduction

Welcome to the **From Skeletal Motion to Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA): A Novel Approach to Human Motion Modeling** repository! This project report outlines my research into utilizing CGA as a robust framework for human motion modeling. Conducted as part of my work at Yale University, the study addresses limitations in traditional motion modeling methods such as quaternions and rotation matrices. 

By employing CGA, I developed a pipeline and a CGA-specific autoencoder capable of encoding and reconstructing human motion with high fidelity. This research lays the groundwork for ongoing studies in robotics simulations using CGA, where motion modeling precision is critical for advanced tasks like trajectory planning and human-robot interaction.

## Key Highlights

- **Affiliation**: Yale University, Department of Computer Science, Apollo Lab
- **Goal**: Explore Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) as a unified mathematical framework for modeling and reconstructing human motion.
- **Result**: Developed a CGA-specific autoencoder to process motion data encoded as multivectors, achieving high accuracy in reconstructing complex, high-speed motions like a hockey slapshot.
- **Ongoing Research**: This work directly informs my ongoing research into robotics simulations using CGA for advanced motion modeling applications.
